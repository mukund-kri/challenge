# Challenge utility


## Target audience
This utility is primarally for me. I don't see any one else using this
package. But if you are here, then feel free to read through the code
and adapted to your needs.

## Aim
Participating in the '100 days of Code' for various tech, is fun and
rewarding. But there are many `Boilerplate` tasks like creating
directories for challenge days, etc. are painful. This command line
app automates all those boring tasks, following the philosophy of
"Automate the boring stuff".

## Installation

```
pub global activate -sgit https://github.com/mukund-kri/challenge
```

## Usage

```
challenge -h 
```

Should be enough of a guide.
